	<h3 class="first">Profile Summary</h3>

	<p class="first">I am a passionate and driven undergraduate student pursuing a degree in <b>Computer Science</b>.
		With a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications, I am dedicated to expanding my
		knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>

	<h3>Academic Background</h3>

	<p>I am currently enrolled in the <b>The University of Westminster</b>, the <b>Computer Science program</b>, where I
		am gained a solid understanding of key programming languages such as <i>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and
			Java</i>. My coursework has covered a range of topics, including <i>data structures, algorithms, software
			engineering, web design and development and database management.. or state anything else relevant to your
			course</i>.</p>

	<h3>Projects</h3>

	<p>Although I am still in the first year of my studies, I have actively engaged in hands-on projects to apply
		theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. Notable projects include the development of <b> a web site for
			one of the Research Groups at the University</b>. Additionally, I collaborated on a team project to design
		and implement <b>a prototype mobile game.</b></p>
